# Problem Set 1
_Due on July 11, 2017._

## Notes
* Written solutions are in [`math.pdf`](./math.pdf). The first Bayes problem is missing (ran out of time).
* Prediction solution is in [`predict.py`](./predict.py). The skeleton is all there (use some rules before resorting to random) but I haven't yet added the rules (ran out of time again).
* I apologize for the incompleteness. I had another assignment due and couldn't get both done on-time. I hope I get partial marks because the logic is there.

## Documentation
Run `predict.py` and you'll have to enter the first three outcomes (using {0,1,2} for {Rock,Paper,Scissors} respectively). After that, it uses a rule base and the last three results (that number can be changed with the variable `k`) and informs you about what to do next. After each turn you enter the opponent's move and it'll predict your next move for you.
