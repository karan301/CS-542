# Problem Set 3
[Assignment PDF](./ps3.pdf). _Due on July 26, 2017._

## Notes
* Written solutions are in [`math.pdf`](./math.pdf).
* Programming solutions are in the [`Code`](./Code/) folder.
	* [`sampleIMAGES.m`](./Code/sampleIMAGES.m).
	* [`sparseAutoencoderCost.m`](./Code/sparseAutoencoderCost.m).
	* [`computeNumericalGradient.m`](./Code/computeNumericalGradient.m).
	* [`weights.jpg`](./Code/weights.jpg).

## Documentation
Follow the assignment instructions. I got [`weights.jpg`](./Code/weights.jpg) to be produced by running `matlab` followed by `run train` in the [`Code`](./Code/) directory on a `csa2` terminal.
